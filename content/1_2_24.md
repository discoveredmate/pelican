Summary: Just trying to work out Pelican

### Goals:
It's the new year. I've been tempted to ask my cohort if they have any programming blogs, but have been kinda scared. To combat my own imposter syndrome and fear around sucking at coding, I've decided to create my own.

I guess I'm just gunna experiment with stuff every week or so and document my learning/opinions.

> I wanted a blog site that could run on github pages and use markdown, so I'm using python/pelican. Wish me luck!
